1.) The position property allows you to specify the position of an element in three different ways.
2.) When set to relative, an element's position is relative to its default position on the page.
3.) When set to absolute, an element's position can be pinned to any part of the web page, but the element will still move out of view when the page is scrolled.
4.) When set to fixed, an element's position can be pinned to any part of the web page. The element will remain in view no matter what.
5.) The z-index of an element specifies how far back or how far forward an element appears on the page.
6.) The float property can move elements as far left or as far right as possible on a web page.
7.) You can clear an element's left or right side (or both) using the clear property.
